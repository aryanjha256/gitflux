# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Most Changed Files Analysis feature allows users to identify which files in a GitHub repository have been modified most frequently over time. This feature will extend the existing GitHub Repository Analyzer by providing insights into code churn, helping developers understand which parts of the codebase are most active and potentially identify areas that may need refactoring or additional attention.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to see which files change most frequently in a repository so that I can identify high-churn areas of the codebase.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing a repository analysis page THEN the system SHALL display a "Most Changed Files" section
2. WHEN the most changed files data loads THEN the system SHALL show a ranked list of files by change frequency
3. WHEN displaying file change data THEN the system SHALL include file path, change count, and percentage of total changes
4. WHEN a file has been deleted THEN the system SHALL still show its historical change data with appropriate indication
5. IF there are no file changes THEN the system SHALL display a message indicating no change history

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to filter the most changed files by time period so that I can analyze recent vs historical activity patterns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing most changed files THEN the system SHALL provide time period filter options (last 30 days, 90 days, 6 months, 1 year, all time)
2. WHEN a time period is selected THEN the system SHALL update the file change rankings for that period
3. WHEN filtering by time period THEN the system SHALL maintain the same display format and sorting
4. WHEN no changes exist in the selected time period THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate message
5. WHEN time period data is loading THEN the system SHALL show loading indicators

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to see file change trends over time so that I can understand if certain files are becoming more or less active.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing a specific file's change data THEN the system SHALL display a trend chart showing changes over time
2. WHEN displaying file trends THEN the system SHALL show change frequency by week or month depending on the time range
3. WHEN hovering over trend data points THEN the system SHALL show detailed information about changes in that period
4. WHEN a file has irregular change patterns THEN the system SHALL clearly visualize the activity spikes
5. IF trend data is insufficient THEN the system SHALL display a message indicating limited trend information

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to see file type breakdown in the change analysis so that I can understand which types of files are most volatile.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing most changed files THEN the system SHALL display a file type distribution chart
2. WHEN showing file type breakdown THEN the system SHALL group files by extension and show change percentages
3. WHEN displaying file types THEN the system SHALL use appropriate colors and labels for different file categories
4. WHEN a file type has no changes THEN the system SHALL exclude it from the visualization
5. WHEN file type data loads THEN the system SHALL show the breakdown alongside the file list

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the most changed files feature to handle large repositories efficiently so that I can analyze repositories with extensive change histories.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing repositories with many commits THEN the system SHALL implement pagination or virtualization for large file lists
2. WHEN API rate limits are approached THEN the system SHALL prioritize the most relevant data and show appropriate warnings
3. WHEN processing large datasets THEN the system SHALL show progress indicators during data loading
4. WHEN memory usage becomes high THEN the system SHALL implement efficient data structures and cleanup
5. IF data processing takes too long THEN the system SHALL provide options to cancel or reduce the analysis scope
