# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Branch/PR Statistics feature provides comprehensive analytics about branch activity and pull request patterns in a GitHub repository. This feature will extend the existing GitHub Repository Analyzer by offering insights into development workflow, collaboration patterns, and code review processes, helping teams understand their development practices and identify areas for improvement.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to see branch statistics so that I can understand the branching patterns and activity in the repository.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing a repository analysis page THEN the system SHALL display a "Branch Statistics" section
2. WHEN branch data loads THEN the system SHALL show total number of branches (active, merged, stale)
3. WHEN displaying branch information THEN the system SHALL include branch names, last commit dates, and commit counts
4. WHEN showing branch data THEN the system SHALL categorize branches as active (recent commits), merged, or stale (no recent activity)
5. IF there are no branches THEN the system SHALL display a message indicating no branch data available

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to see pull request analytics so that I can understand the code review and collaboration patterns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing repository analysis THEN the system SHALL display a "Pull Request Analytics" section
2. WHEN PR data loads THEN the system SHALL show total PRs (open, closed, merged) with counts and percentages
3. WHEN displaying PR metrics THEN the system SHALL include average time to merge, review time, and PR size statistics
4. WHEN showing PR data THEN the system SHALL display top contributors by PR count and review activity
5. IF there are no pull requests THEN the system SHALL display a message indicating no PR history

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to see PR merge patterns over time so that I can understand development velocity and workflow trends.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing PR analytics THEN the system SHALL display a timeline chart of PR activity over time
2. WHEN showing PR timeline THEN the system SHALL include opened, merged, and closed PR counts by time period
3. WHEN displaying PR trends THEN the system SHALL show merge frequency patterns (daily, weekly, monthly)
4. WHEN hovering over timeline data THEN the system SHALL show detailed PR information for that period
5. IF insufficient PR data exists THEN the system SHALL display a message about limited trend information

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to see code review statistics so that I can understand the review process effectiveness.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing PR analytics THEN the system SHALL display code review metrics
2. WHEN showing review data THEN the system SHALL include average reviews per PR, review response time, and approval patterns
3. WHEN displaying reviewer information THEN the system SHALL show top reviewers by activity and review quality metrics
4. WHEN showing review patterns THEN the system SHALL include statistics on review comments, approvals, and change requests
5. IF review data is insufficient THEN the system SHALL display appropriate messaging about limited review information

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to filter branch and PR statistics by time period so that I can analyze recent vs historical patterns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing branch/PR stats THEN the system SHALL provide time period filter options (last 30 days, 90 days, 6 months, 1 year, all time)
2. WHEN a time period is selected THEN the system SHALL update all statistics and charts for that period
3. WHEN filtering by time period THEN the system SHALL maintain consistent data presentation and formatting
4. WHEN no data exists in selected period THEN the system SHALL display appropriate empty state messages
5. WHEN time period data is loading THEN the system SHALL show loading indicators across all components

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the branch/PR analytics to handle large repositories efficiently so that I can analyze repositories with extensive branch and PR histories.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing repositories with many branches/PRs THEN the system SHALL implement efficient data loading and pagination
2. WHEN API rate limits are approached THEN the system SHALL prioritize most relevant data and show warnings
3. WHEN processing large datasets THEN the system SHALL show progress indicators and allow cancellation
4. WHEN memory usage is high THEN the system SHALL implement efficient data structures and cleanup
5. IF data processing takes too long THEN the system SHALL provide options to reduce analysis scope or show partial results
