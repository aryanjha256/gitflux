# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature adds visual analytics to GitFlux that help users understand commit patterns and contributor activity over time. The feature includes two main visualizations: a GitHub-style weekly commit activity heatmap showing when commits happen throughout the week, and contributor trendlines that reveal who is ramping up or slowing down their contributions. These visualizations provide insights into team productivity patterns, individual contributor momentum, and overall project health.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a project manager, I want to see a weekly commit activity heatmap, so that I can understand when my team is most productive and identify patterns in development activity.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user navigates to the commit activity page THEN the system SHALL display a heatmap grid showing commit activity for each day of the week
2. WHEN displaying the heatmap THEN the system SHALL use color intensity to represent commit volume (lighter for fewer commits, darker for more commits)
3. WHEN the user hovers over a heatmap cell THEN the system SHALL display a tooltip showing the exact number of commits for that day
4. WHEN generating the heatmap THEN the system SHALL aggregate commits by day of the week across the selected time period
5. WHEN no commits exist for a particular day THEN the system SHALL display an empty/neutral colored cell
6. WHEN the heatmap loads THEN the system SHALL include day labels (Mon, Tue, Wed, etc.) and time period indicators

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a team lead, I want to see contributor trendlines showing activity changes over time, so that I can identify who is ramping up their contributions or slowing down.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user views the contributor trends section THEN the system SHALL display a line chart showing commit activity trends for each contributor
2. WHEN calculating trends THEN the system SHALL track commits per contributor over rolling time periods (e.g., weekly or monthly)
3. WHEN displaying trendlines THEN the system SHALL use different colors or styles to distinguish between contributors
4. WHEN a contributor's activity is increasing THEN the system SHALL visually indicate an upward trend
5. WHEN a contributor's activity is decreasing THEN the system SHALL visually indicate a downward trend
6. WHEN the user hovers over a trendline point THEN the system SHALL display contributor name and commit count for that period
7. WHEN displaying trends THEN the system SHALL include a legend identifying each contributor

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to filter and customize the time range for both visualizations, so that I can focus on specific periods of interest.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user accesses the visualization controls THEN the system SHALL provide time range selection options (last 30 days, 3 months, 6 months, 1 year)
2. WHEN the user selects a different time range THEN the system SHALL update both the heatmap and trendlines to reflect the new period
3. WHEN applying time filters THEN the system SHALL maintain consistent date ranges across both visualizations
4. WHEN the time range changes THEN the system SHALL recalculate all metrics and update the displays accordingly
5. WHEN no data exists for the selected time range THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate empty state message

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a repository owner, I want the visualizations to load quickly and handle large datasets efficiently, so that the interface remains responsive even for active repositories.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN loading commit data THEN the system SHALL display loading indicators while processing
2. WHEN processing large datasets THEN the system SHALL implement data aggregation to maintain performance
3. WHEN the visualizations render THEN the system SHALL complete initial load within 3 seconds for typical repositories
4. WHEN data is being fetched THEN the system SHALL provide progressive loading or skeleton states
5. IF data processing fails THEN the system SHALL display clear error messages with retry options
6. WHEN switching between time ranges THEN the system SHALL cache previously loaded data to improve subsequent load times
