  - Write unit tests for data transformation functions with edge cases
  - _Requirements: 1.4, 2.2, 3.3_

- [x] 2. Extend GitHub API integration





  - Add new API functions to fetch commit data with contributor information for specified time ranges
  - Implement caching mechanism for commit activity data to improve performance
  - Create error handling for API rate limits and network failures specific to commit activity endpoints
  - Write tests for API integration functions with mocked GitHub responses
  - _Requirements: 4.1, 4.5, 4.6_

- [x] 3. Create CommitActivityHeatmap component











  - Build heatmap grid component using CSS Grid with 7-column layout for days of the week
  - Implement color intensity mapping based on commit volume using Tailwind CSS classes
  - Add interactive hover tooltips showing commit count and date information
  - Create responsive design that adapts grid cell sizes for mobile devices
  - Write comprehensive tests for heatmap rendering and interactions
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.5, 1.6_

- [x] 4. Implement ContributorTrendlines component








  - Create multi-line chart component using Recharts LineChart for contributor trends
  - Implement distinct color coding and line styles for different contributors
  - Add interactive legend with contributor filtering capabilities
  - Create hover tooltips displaying contributor names and commit counts for specific time periods
  - Write tests for trendline rendering, interactions, and contributor filtering
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4, 2.5, 2.6, 2.7_

- [x] 5. Build ActivityVisualizationPanel container component





  - Create container component that orchestrates both heatmap and trendlines with shared state
  - Implement time range filtering controls that update both visualizations simultaneously
  - Add responsive layout switching between stacked (mobile) and side-by-side (desktop) arrangements
  - Create loading state coordination and error boundary for graceful error handling
  - Write integration tests for component coordination and shared state management
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4, 3.5_

- [x] 6. Add accessibility features and keyboard navigation





  - Implement ARIA labels and roles for complex visualizations
  - Add keyboard navigation support for interactive elements in both components
  - Create screen reader friendly data summaries and alternative text for visual elements
  - Ensure color contrast compliance and focus indicators meet WCAG 2.1 AA standards
  - Write accessibility tests using jest-axe and manual keyboard navigation testing
  - _Requirements: 1.6, 2.7, 4.4_

- [x] 7. Implement performance optimizations








  - Add React.memo optimization for expensive rendering operations in both components
  - Implement data caching and memoization for transformation functions
  - Create loading indicators and skeleton states for better perceived performance
  - Add error retry mechanisms with exponential backoff for failed API requests
  - Write performance tests to ensure components handle large datasets efficiently
  - _Requirements: 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4, 4.6_

- [x] 8. Create route and page integration





  - Add new route at `/repo/[owner]/[repo]/activity` for dedicated activity analysis page
  - Integrate ActivityVisualizationPanel into the new route with proper error boundaries
  - Implement URL parameter handling for time range persistence and deep linking
  - Add navigation links from existing repository analysis pages to the new activity page
  - Write end-to-end tests for the complete user flow from repository input to activity visualization
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4, 3.5_
