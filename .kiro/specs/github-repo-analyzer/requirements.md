# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The GitHub Repository Analyzer is a feature that allows users to input a GitHub repository URL and view comprehensive analytics about the repository, including commit history charts and contributor information. This feature will be implemented as a dynamic route in the Next.js application that fetches data from the GitHub API and presents it through interactive visualizations.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to enter a GitHub repository URL so that I can analyze its activity and contributors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user navigates to `/app/analyze/[owner]/[repo]` THEN the system SHALL display a repository analysis page
2. WHEN a user accesses the analysis page THEN the system SHALL show a form to input GitHub repository URLs
3. WHEN a user enters a valid GitHub URL (format: github.com/owner/repo) THEN the system SHALL parse the owner and repository name
4. WHEN a user submits an invalid URL format THEN the system SHALL display appropriate validation errors
5. IF the repository does not exist THEN the system SHALL display a "repository not found" message

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to see commit activity charts so that I can understand the development timeline and frequency.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN repository data is successfully fetched THEN the system SHALL display a commit history chart
2. WHEN displaying commit data THEN the system SHALL show commits over time with appropriate date ranges
3. WHEN the chart loads THEN the system SHALL present commit frequency in a visually clear format
4. IF there are no commits THEN the system SHALL display a message indicating no commit history
5. WHEN commit data is loading THEN the system SHALL show appropriate loading indicators

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to see contributor information so that I can understand who has contributed to the repository.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN repository data is loaded THEN the system SHALL display a list of contributors
2. WHEN showing contributors THEN the system SHALL include contributor names, avatars, and contribution counts
3. WHEN displaying contributor data THEN the system SHALL sort contributors by contribution count (descending)
4. IF there are no contributors THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate message
5. WHEN contributor data is loading THEN the system SHALL show loading indicators

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the application to handle GitHub API rate limits gracefully so that I can continue using the service reliably.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN GitHub API rate limits are exceeded THEN the system SHALL display an informative error message
2. WHEN API requests fail THEN the system SHALL provide retry mechanisms where appropriate
3. WHEN authentication is required for private repos THEN the system SHALL handle unauthorized access gracefully
4. IF network errors occur THEN the system SHALL display appropriate error messages
5. WHEN API responses are slow THEN the system SHALL show loading states to maintain user experience

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the analysis page to be responsive and accessible so that I can use it on different devices and screen sizes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing on mobile devices THEN the system SHALL display charts and components in a mobile-friendly layout
2. WHEN using keyboard navigation THEN the system SHALL support proper tab order and focus management
3. WHEN using screen readers THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate ARIA labels and descriptions
4. WHEN charts are displayed THEN the system SHALL include alternative text descriptions for accessibility
5. IF JavaScript is disabled THEN the system SHALL show a graceful degradation message
